This project is developed by the team in a workshop in Audio Programming Course at NTNU in February, 2019. The course falls under 
the Music Communication & Technology Program, **[( MCT NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mmct)** & **[(MCT UiO)](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/)**, which is a joint collaborative program between Norwegian Institute of Science & Technology and the University of Oslo . 

The code is written in javascript language using p5.js library and includes a drum solo by Thomas Lang. The drum solo has been used as an input for convolution which further processes a live audio input. Finally the mix of the sound is visualized using the fft function in p5.js and sent to the main output at the same time.

The [picture](https://github.com/shreejayshrestha/Convolvorizer/blob/master/image3.jpg) used in the application is inspired by our project theme. While looking for an inspiration, I found [this beautiful picture](https://github.com/shreejayshrestha/Convolvorizer/blob/master/original-pic.jpg) laying in my personal album which I had taken in 2017 in Trondheim. The way how both the exterior and interior view got mixed on the huge window glass somehow reflects the interplay of sounds in our project. To give it a more sketchy look and relate the convolution process in particular, I modified it using various filters like **liquify**, **noise** etc in phososhop.

## Acknowledgement
Our heartfelt gratitude to our teacher [Anna Xambo](https://github.com/axambo) for guiding us all through the process from Day 1 to Day 4. Thank you 
so much for your support and patience which helped us learn and practice coding in Web Audio API, Html, javascript, CSS and p5.js. 
Similarly, thanks to all our peers and audience for their constructive feedbacks and suggestions.
Besides, we would also like to take this opportunity to thank [Hamed Kazemi](https://www.facebook.com/hamed.kazemi) for his collaboration 
in the working process. And last but not the least, a big thanks to shiffman from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)
for sharing his huge collection of tutorials on YouTube. I watched the [Sound Visualization tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4) which gave me
a lot of insingts in creating a similar kind of visualization for this project.
