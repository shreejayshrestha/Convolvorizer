# Convolvorizer
This project is developed with team of 4 members in Audio Programming Course at NTNU in February, 2019. The course falls under 
the Music Communication & Technology Program, **[( MCT NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mmct)** & **[(MCT UiO)](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/)**, which is a joint collaborative program between Norwegian Institute of Science & Technology and the University of Oslo . The code is written in javascript language using the p5.js library and uses a drum solo by Thomas Lang. The drum solo has been used as an input for convolution which again processes a live audio input. Finally the mix of the sound is visualized using the fft function in p5.js and is sent to the main output.

The [picture](https://github.com/shreejayshrestha/Convolvorizer/blob/master/image3.jpg) used in the project is my own creation. You can see me clicking the [original picture](https://github.com/shreejayshrestha/Convolvorizer/blob/master/original-pic.jpg) which has been modified using various filters like **liquify**, **noise** etc in phososhop.

## Acknowledgement
Our heartfelt gratitude to our teacher [Anna Xambo](https://github.com/axambo) for guiding us all through the process from Day 1 to Day 4. Thank you 
so much for your support and patience which helped us learn and practice coding in Web Audio API, Html, javascript, CSS and p5.js. 
Similarly, thanks to all our peers and audience for their constructive feedbacks and suggestions.
Besides, we would also like to take this opportunity to thank [Hamed Kazemi](https://www.facebook.com/hamed.kazemi) for his collaboration 
in the working process. And last but not the least, a big thanks to shiffman from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)
for sharing his huge collection of tutorials on YouTube. I watched the [Sound Visualization tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4) which gave me
a lot of insingts in creating a similar kind of visualization for this project.
